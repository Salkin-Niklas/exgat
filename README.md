# SpaceCleanup
For decades old satellites have been left in space, broken and inactive. Now that our space station has to cross one of these regions we will need to shield its fragile solar panels from all scrap. Time to collect all the debris in large nets to return this junk to earth so we can dispose it correctly!

### Controls

- Use W to Boost with your main engine. The ship will not slow down, so you will need to boost in the counterdirection to stop
- Use A and D to turn
- Use Space to toggle your tractor beam. When turning with debris, turn slowly.
- You can pause the game using TAB

Collect Debris into the nets to gain points when they contract. Do not let debris touch your space station!
